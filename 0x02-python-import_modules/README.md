# 0x02. Python - import & modules

## Project Description
This project focuses on understanding Python's module system, importing functions from files, working with command line arguments, and adhering to coding style guidelines using pycodestyle.

## Learning Objectives
After completing this project, you should be able to explain:

### General
- Why Python programming is awesome
- How to import functions from another file
- How to use imported functions
- How to create a module
- How to use the built-in function `dir()`
- How to prevent code in your script from being executed when imported
